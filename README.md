# Prolucid Interview
## Tyler Thomson

For this technichal interview I was tasked to arrange a short story's sentences in alphabetic order. Some initial assumptions I have made are that we want to preserve the sentence structure. Additionally I have assumed as sentence is anything concluding in;
- .
- ?
- !
- \n
- ;

I was able to accomplish the rust program in a naive approach 08/02/23 after starting 07/02/23. I chose rust because it's a language I want to get better at and thought it would prove a good test for me. I also figured why not shoot for the moon. So my hope is to perform the assigned task in C and python as well, then move my rust program into the alph.rs file, call all three using sub processes and compare their general efficency and display the results using rust through a standard output. Stretch goal for sure but I think it sounds cool and I want you to think I am cool. Maybe if that doesn't crush me completely I will wrap it in a pretty (ugly) GUI! With Charts! Diagrams! Snarky comments!
